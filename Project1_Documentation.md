# Mediated Extensions of Self

## Process and Documentation

**Week 1 (1/26/23)**
  - Idea: 
    - Step tracker by using a force pressure sensor, placed on the ball of the foot (if possible and if the item comes in time, using pulse sensor to monitor heart rate)

  - Research:
    - Personal experience: I do not walk a lot due to having to work and sit at my desk. A motivation to move my body around and take breaks.
    - I intend on strapping the pressure sensor on the heel of my foot and when I step on the at least twice it will detect I have placed my feet down and collect data



**Week 2 (2/2/23)**
  - Prototyping Moodboard

    - This foot chart allows me to determine where to place the force pressure sensor for optimal accuracy for data collection

  - Hardware

      - Initial protoyping phases to better understand the specs and using two LED lights as visual ques to determine pressure sensor's sensitivity
  - Software (Code)

  - Data Collection

    - After a change in wires the collection of data began to stabilize 

  - Ideas for visuals using p5.js
    - Bigger the circle the more steps within an interval of time

  - Next Steps
    - Begin to prototype the step tracker!
    - Where will the battery and breadboard exist as the force pressure sensor is attaced to heel?

**Week 3 (2/9/23)**
  - Hardware Process
    - Initial

    - Drafts

      - Began to crochet a small pouch for the breadboard and battery to rest around the end-users' ankles
    - Final Product

    - Added a button so the flap of pouch can secure the device in place incase end-user's would run or jump
  - Software

  - Data

    - Collected my steps for about 10 minutes 
  - Visualization  
<img width="1726" alt="Screen Shot 2023-02-09 at 12 29 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113642855/217772058-8b67b692-1d90-4643-8be8-e12922fcf49d.png">
    - As previously mentioned in Week 2, the circles visualize the data linearly. So the bigger the circle, the more steps taken, the smaller, the less.
