# Mediated Extensions of Self

## Process and Documentation

**Week 1 (1/26/23)**
  - Idea: 
    - Step tracker by using a force pressure sensor, placed on the ball of the foot (if possible and if the item comes in time, using pulse sensor to monitor heart rate)

  - Research:
    - Personal experience: I do not walk a lot due to having to work and sit at my desk. A motivation to move my body around and take breaks.
    - I intend on strapping the pressure sensor on the heel of my foot and when I step on the at least twice it will detect I have placed my feet down and collect data

**Week 2 (2/2/23)**
  - Prototyping Moodboard

- This foot chart allows me to determine where to place the force pressure sensor for optimal accuracy for data collection
- Hardware
