# Build for play

## Process and Documentation

  - Idea: A continuation of my Virtual Dream Space. In my Virtual Dream Space, it was between the realms of concious and unconcious, so the goal of the game is to try to get out of a dream but in order to do so players would need to collect a certain amount of coins in order to escape.
  - Process:
    - Controller:

    - I will be using an AdaFruit Circuit Playground Express's accelerometer; players would need to tilt the Circuit Playground in order to move around

    - I also crocheted a quick encasement for the controller
